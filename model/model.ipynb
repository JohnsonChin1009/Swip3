    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rapidly evolving Web 3 space, identifying the right candidates with the perfect combination of skills is essential. **Market Basket Analysis (MBA)**, a popular technique originally used in retail to analyze customer purchases, can be repurposed to help recruiters discover common **skillsets** that tend to appear together in successful candidates. In our Web 3 job recruitment platform **Swip3**, we apply **Market Basket Analysis** to recommend candidates based on the skillsets that are frequently associated with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "For recruiters, this provides critical insights into not only which skills are essential for a given role but also which combinations of skills are most likely to lead to success in the dynamic Web 3 landscape. **Swip3** leverages these insights to optimize candidate recommendations, ensuring that recruiters find individuals who possess complementary and valuable skills for specific job roles in decentralized technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Use Case: Swip3 Skillset Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Swip3** aims to match Web 3 researchers and developers with companies seeking talent in the blockchain and decentralized technology space. By applying **Market Basket Analysis** to past successful hires and candidate skillsets, we can identify **frequent patterns** in skill combinations that are valued by recruiters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- Candidates proficient in **Solidity** are often skilled in **Ethereum** development.\n",
    "- Those with experience in **Smart Contracts** often have expertise in building **dApps**.\n",
    "- Developers familiar with **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** may also have experience in **Blockchain Security**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These relationships can guide recruiters to select candidates with the most **comprehensive** and **complementary** skillsets, even if those skills were not explicitly mentioned in the job description."

    "## 3. Definition of Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Market Basket Analysis** is powered by **association rule learning**, a rule-based machine learning technique that identifies relationships between items in a dataset. In the case of **Swip3**, the \"items\" are **skills** or **competencies** possessed by candidates. The objective is to find **strong associations** between these skillsets, which can then be used to make more informed recruitment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used algorithm for this analysis is the **Apriori Algorithm**, which finds frequent itemsets (skill combinations) and generates **association rules** that predict the likelihood of one skill leading to another. This is based on two key metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1. Support\n",
    "- **Definition**: Support measures how frequently a combination of skillsets (itemset) appears in the dataset. For example, if **Solidity** and **Smart Contracts** frequently co-occur in the profiles of successful candidates, this combination will have high support.\n",
    "  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "Support(X \\Rightarrow Y) = \\frac{|X \\cup Y|}{N}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) represent skillsets, and \\( N \\) is the total number of candidate profiles analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2. Confidence\n",
    "- **Definition**: Confidence measures the strength of the association between skillsets. It tells us how likely it is that a candidate who possesses one skill will also possess the related skill.\n",
    "  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "Confidence(X \\Rightarrow Y) = \\frac{|X \\cap Y|}{|X|}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a candidate is skilled in **Solidity**, how likely are they to also have experience with **Ethereum**?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3. Lift\n",
    "- **Definition**: Lift measures how much more likely two skillsets are to appear together than if they were independent of each other. A Lift greater than 1 indicates a strong association.\n",
    "  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "Lift(X \\Rightarrow Y) = \\frac{Confidence(X \\Rightarrow Y)}{Support(Y)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if candidates proficient in **Blockchain Security** are much more likely to also know **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** than by chance, the Lift value will be significantly greater than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Conviction\n",
    "The conviction of a rule is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "conv(X \\Rightarrow Y) = \\frac{1 - supp(Y)}{1 - conf(X \\Rightarrow Y)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be interpreted as the ratio of the expected frequency that X occurs without Y if X and Y were independent divided by the observed frequency of incorrect predictions. A high value means that the consequent depends strongly on the antecedent.\n"

    "## 4. Application in Swip3\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Swip3**, we apply the **Apriori Algorithm** to analyze candidate profiles, discovering frequent patterns in Web 3 skillsets. Here’s how this can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1. Identifying Strong Skill Combinations\n",
    "- By analyzing historical data of successful hires, we can determine common skill combinations that are highly valued by recruiters. For example, we might find that candidates proficient in **DeFi protocols** also tend to have skills in **Smart Contract Auditing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2. Improving Job Descriptions and Recommendations\n",
    "- Based on the findings of our analysis, **Swip3** can recommend improved job descriptions to recruiters, suggesting which skill combinations are most likely to attract candidates who meet the role’s requirements.\n",
    "  \n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "- A job posting for a **Web 3 Security Researcher** might be updated to highlight **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** and **Smart Contract Auditing**, based on frequent co-occurrences in previous hires.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3. Personalized Candidate Recommendations\n",
    "- Recruiters can benefit from personalized candidate suggestions based on skillset combinations. If a recruiter is looking for a **Solidity Developer**, Swip3 can suggest candidates who also possess complementary skills such as **Ethereum**, **dApps development**, or **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**, increasing the likelihood of a successful hire.\n"
