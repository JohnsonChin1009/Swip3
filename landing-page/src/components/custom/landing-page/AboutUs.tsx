        Web3 hiring is wild. The best projects skip traditional job boards and drop opportunities on Twitter, like:<br/><br/>
        &ldquo;We&apos;re looking for a Solidity dev! If you breathe DeFi, DM us! #crypto #Web3Jobs&rdquo; â€“ @CoolDeFiProject<br /><br />
        For job seekers, it&apos;s exciting but easy to miss out. While Web2 job hunting feels like endless forms, Web3 should be about freedom, fun, and community. So why not make it as smooth as finding your next shitcoin?
